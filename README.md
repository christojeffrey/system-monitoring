# setup

I uses python 3.12. not tested with any other python version.

0. Recommended to use virtual enviroment to keep everything local. to do it,

```bash
python -m venv .venv # to create the local environment
source .venv/bin/activate # to activate the environment
deactivate # to deactivate the environment
```

to use the virtual environment, active it first before you install and run the code. then deactivate it when you are done.

1. install the requirement using

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. to run

```bash
python src/main.py
```

3. to test

```bash
 python -m unittest
```
